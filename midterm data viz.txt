Let's start by looking at the overall distribution of Pokémon weights. The data is strongly right-skewed, meaning most Pokémon are relatively light. The median weight of Pokémon is 30. There are some notable outliers.

3)
Pokémon can be further divided into weight classes: Light, Medium, and Heavy. The Light class is the most common at 95 observations. The Heavy class is the smallest group, with only 22 Pokémon.

5)
Pokémon with Ghost and Rock primary types have the lightest and heaviest mean weights respectively. 66% of Ghost type Pokémon are light and none are heavy. In contrast Rock type Pokémon are a bit more evenly distributed in weight classes.

6)
Comparing Ghost and Rock type Pokémon Ghost types much lighter on average.
They have a mean of 13.57 kg and have a clear peak near 0 kg.
Rock types have a mean of 87.61 kg and have a clear peak near 40 kg.
Rock types are a lot more heavy on average and the weight is more varied.

9) 
We are looking at the relationship between height and weight.To better visualize this, we removed major outliers like Golem and Gengar, which would otherwise drastically skew the trend.

For Ghost-types their weight stays fairly constant regardless of height.

For Rock-type Pokémon, there’s a strong positive linear trend—as height increases, weight does too.

This is a correlation matrix of Attach, Height, Weight, and Speed for all Pokémon. 
Height and weight have a strong correlation at 0.57
Speed and weight are not highly correlated, so speed can't be predicted by weight alone.
